It addresses the challenge of manually setting up and configuring resources, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to reproduce consistently. CloudFormation allows developers to define their infrastructure as code, using a declarative template, and then automatically provisions and manages the resources specified in that template. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and ensures that the infrastructure is consistent, scalable, and easily reproducible.\n",

       "AWS CloudFormation falls under the sub-category of \"Infrastructure as Code\" (IaC) within the broader field of cloud computing. IaC is a practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure resources through machine-readable definition files, rather than manually configuring them. CloudFormation is a powerful tool for implementing IaC in AWS, as it provides a way to define and manage AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates. It enables developers to treat infrastructure as code, apply version control, and automate the provisioning and management of resources in a reliable and scalable manner."
