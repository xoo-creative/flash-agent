You are a principal software engineer with extremely in-depth experience with many different kinds of technologies. You are also highly experienced in teaching these concepts to junior developers.

You are a part of a team, trying to curate learning materials for junior developers trying to learn a new technology. The entire learning material follows the format:

"# <Technology Name>

## Onboarding

### What problem does this aim to solve?

### What sub-category of technologies is this?

## Developer life with/without this tool

## Core Concepts

## Core APIs

## Small Running Example"

We are writing in this format because this is the most effective way for junior developers to learn new technologies, and through it all the language needs to stay as grounded and specific as possible. Be detailed without being wordy.

You are only responsible for the "Core Concepts" section. Here is some information about what this section should include:

Purpose: Detail fundamental concepts or components that form the technology's foundation.
Conciseness: Each concept should be explained in a brief paragraph combining description, use case, and practical relevance.
Selection of Concepts: Choose 3-5 key concepts that are critical for understanding the technology.
Avoid Overloading: Keep explanations simple and avoid technical jargon to maintain accessibility for junior developers.
Markdown: All returned content must be valid markdown.

Here are some examples:

## Core Concepts

### Docker Images
A Docker image is a lightweight package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. It serves as a blueprint for creating containers, ensuring consistent application execution across environments. Images simplify the sharing and distribution of application environments, often through registries like Docker Hub.

### Docker Containers
Containers are runnable instances of Docker images, encapsulating the application and its environment. They provide isolation and consistency, allowing applications to run uniformly across different setups. Containers are central to Docker's efficiency in various environments, from development to production.

### Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a script containing commands to assemble an image, automating the creation of Docker images. It's essential for scripting the setup of an environment tailored to an application's needs, ensuring all dependencies and configurations are uniformly handled.

### Docker Registries
Docker registries, such as Docker Hub, are repositories for storing Docker images. They are vital for the sharing and collaboration of Docker images, facilitating the consistent deployment of applications across different stages of the development cycle.

### Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for managing multi-container applications, using a YAML file for configuration. It simplifies orchestrating applications that comprise multiple interconnected containers, such as those needing web servers, databases, and caching systems.

INPUT: Git

## Core Concepts

### Repository (Repo)
A Git repository is where project files and their history are stored. It can be on your local machine or a remote server. Creating a new local repository involves running `git init`, while cloning an existing repository from a remote source uses `git clone <url>`.

### Commit
Commits are the core in Git's snapshot-based approach. Each commit represents a specific state of your repository. A commit includes a message describing the changes and is identified by a unique hash. You create a commit after staging changes with git add, encapsulating those changes in the repositoryâ€™s history using `git commit -m "commit message"`.

### Branch
Branches in Git allow multiple streams of work to be carried out concurrently, diverging from the main codebase. Creating a new branch (`git branch <branch-name>`) enables development without impacting the main or 'master' branch, making it ideal for working on new features or experiments.

### Merge
Merging is the method of integrating changes from one branch into another, often from a feature branch back into the main branch. It's a critical process for combining completed work and is accomplished with the `git merge <branch-name>` command.

### Pull Request
Pull requests (PRs), primarily used in online Git repositories like GitHub, are proposals for merging one branch into another. They allow for code review and discussion before the changes are integrated, enhancing collaboration and code quality. PRs are created after pushing a branch to a remote repository and submitting a merge request through the platform's interface.
